# Basic Commands
- npx create-react-app [app-name] => Creates a new react project. Takes awhile.
- npx build
- npx start


# JSX
- Syntax extension
- Describe what the UI look like.
- Produces React "elements"
- Components -> logic and markup loosely coupled and also concerns (SoC)
- After compilation JSX becomes normal JS
    - Becomes React.createElement() calls.
- JSX prevents injection attacks


# Components
- Should have only a single root element (unless fragments <React.Fragment>)
- Class Components
    - Good'ol class
- Functional Components
    - Function that returns a valid react component
- Dumb components : they don't care what kind of data is being passed in. Only looks ;)
